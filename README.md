# model predictive control


### Problem description
-------------------------

An inverted pendulum is a classic problem in non-linear dynamics and control.

The cart is a one dimensional horizontally moving base; The mass of the pendulum is evenly distributed; and It is assumed that the rod is massless.

| Variable | Definition |
| -------- | ---------- |
|     M    | Mass of the cart (kg)                       |
|     L    | Length of the pendulum's centre of mass (m) |
|     F    | Force Applied to cart (N)                   |
|     m    | Mass of the pendulum (kg)                   |
|     x    | Cart horizontal displacement from origin    |
